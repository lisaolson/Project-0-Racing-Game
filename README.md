### Description

I built this game using primarily HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  I used Bootstrap just for one button on the page. This project produces a two-player racing game through keypress events ('A' and 'L'). The two users race until one of them reaches the finish line.
I used HTML to form the divs separating the two 'players' and the background image(racetrack). I used CSS to stylize the divs and I used Javascript and jQuery to form the conditions stating when each player 'won' when they got to the finish line.
My approach was to first form two divs that would move across the screen with a keypress event. Once I had that working, I added images within those two divs, representing the two players, then I added a background image set at a certain pixel amount.  I then wrote jQuery and JavaScript to add conditionals and functions that would execute when the divs reached the finished line, producing an alert on the screen for the user.

Eventually, I want to replace the alerts with text that will show up on the screen.  I didn't quite get there yet on this game, but I want to add that feature as well as a countdown timer leading to when the two players can start racing.  I also plan to add a scoreboard so that multiple games could be played.
